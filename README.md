## These are my script files 

The scripts in the folders are some of the larger projects while the scripts in this folder are simple ones that I just wanted to automate at some point / bind them to various keys.

Short descriptions of noteworthy scripts:

compiler - compile a latex document
cpwd - copy working dir to clipboard
creds - copy an account name to clipboard
gc - git commit
mt - mount device to /media/mt\*
new - new shell script
newc - new shell program
se - script edit
sn - script new
syncgit - sync local computer with remote server
texclear - clear intermediate latex files
vimtex - open latex file and use entr to achieve "live preview"
